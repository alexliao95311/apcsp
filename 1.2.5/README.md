# Python Asteroids Shooter Game 

## Project Overview

This is an arcade-style shooter game developed in Python using the **Pygame** library. The objective is to control a defensive turret (the "Gun") at the bottom of the screen to shoot and destroy incoming asteroids before they hit the ground.

The project follows the **SCRUM** framework, with development split into two distinct Sprints.

## Gameplay Features (What you can expect to play)

The final game will include the following core mechanics and features:

1.  **Defense Turret:** A player-controlled gun positioned at the bottom center of the screen.
2.  **Movement:** The gun can move horizontally (left and right) to aim.
3.  **Firing:** The player can fire projectiles (bullets) upwards at incoming targets.
4.  **Falling Asteroids:** Asteroids appear randomly at the top of the screen and fall downwards at varying speeds.
5.  **Destruction:** Asteroids are destroyed when hit by a player's bullet.
6.  **Scoring:** Players earn points for every destroyed asteroid.
7.  **Lives System:** The player has a limited number of lives. A life is lost every time an asteroid hits the ground.
8.  **Game Over:** A clear screen is displayed when the player runs out of lives, showing the final score.
9.  **Difficulty Scaling:** The game gradually gets harder, increasing the speed and frequency of asteroid spawning over time.
10. **Visual & Audio Polish:** Dedicated sprites for game objects and sound effects for shooting and explosions.
